      Iâ€™m Melvin, a full stack software developer, solopreneur, and fintech enthusiast. Currently learning computer science fundamentals in Bina Nusantara University,Indonesia.
      My interest in software development started back in 2018,when I decided to learn HTML & CSS from w3school, inspired by my ex-employer who studied computer science in University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)<br><br> Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at a coding private school, an investment education start-up, and huge fintech corporation. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences for a variety of clients.
