# 2 Things I Wish I know before majoring in computer science

### Math is still important!!

There are a few times where someone asks me, "I am kinda interested to enroll in computer science, but I hate math, will we learn a lot of math in computer science?" <br/><br/>

The very best answer someone could give should be "do you hate to calculate in math or to analyze in math concept ?" since we probably won't use a lot of calculating, but the mathematical concept is required in many to all disciplines of computer science <br/><br/>

In my experience I had this mathematic courses that I can't avoid in my university: Discrete Matematics, Linear Algebra, Calculus

### You probably won't learn much about coding

Coding here means building a program that a user can use, whether it is a web application or a mobile application. <br /><br />

In my first year, as a freshman, my university hardly taught me anything related to "coding" (and I assume, your university probably is the same), the course is mostly about algorithms, data structures (with C language), and object-oriented programming (Java). <br /><br /> 

At first, I was a bit shocked, instead of learning how to make a CRUD web application, my very first course was about printing a different pattern of shape (rectangle, square, etc) on my terminal with C language ðŸ˜‚ <br /><br />

Do not expect, that a computer science major will teach you how to build a giant complex e-commerce system or a billion-dollar social media app. In computer science, you will learn a lot about how everything works under the hood, such as time complexity, and etc. <br/><br/>

But to be honest, that is not a problem, and in my opinion, that is a good start. Learning a new javascript framework for your web application seems fun, but what if the code that you write is a "jumbled code", and hardly easy for other developers to understand? what if there is a function that has a large time complexity that slows down your web application? What if you have a chance to work at FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) or a unicorn startup in Indonesia (Tokopedia, Gojek, etc) but you failed to solve the algorithm interview problems? **(This happened to one of my acquaintance)** <br /><br />

My suggestion is that, learn about coding somewhere else (Udemy, Youtube, Coursera, join a student club in your university, etc), since you won't learn much about coding in university, for comparison, if you happen to come from Indonesia university, they probably gonna teach the very basic of HTML, CSS, and Javascript on your second year.
